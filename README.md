# SolidJS Wordle

A [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) implementation of the [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). It was produced as part of a [Mirahi Growth Session](https://github.com/mirahi-io/growth). This is just for fun and doesn't aim to 100% replicate the original. This repository is open sourced for learning purposes only - the original creator(s) of Wordle own all applicable rights to the game itself.
